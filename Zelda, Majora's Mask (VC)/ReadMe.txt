Use the Patcher64+ Tool and do NOT apply the "Expand Memory" option to Majora's Mask in order for the Action Replay Codes to work.

Both Redux and Vanilla Majora's Mask already run on 8MB RAM. Further increasing it is not required.

Redux is NOT required as Action Replay code will still work without it.

This only applies to the US (NTSC-U) version. EU (PAL) or JPN (NTSC-J) requires different codes.
