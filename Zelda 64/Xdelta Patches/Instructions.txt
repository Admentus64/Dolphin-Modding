For fans of playing Ocarina of Time, Master Quest or Majora's Mask in languages which are not officially supported.

First, make a backup or the original textures. Alternatively you can always re-download the texture pack to restore the languages.

Go into the folder of language you wish to mod and drag and copy the whole PZL folder within it at it's usual place (My Documents/Dolphin/Load/Textures/) and allow to replace the contents in the PZL folder.

Remember that the PZL folder is used when using the The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition disc. Other game versions refer to different folder names which you have to rename. Folder names include:

- D43 (The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Master Quest) (GameCube)
- NAC (The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time) (Virtual Console)
- NAR (The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask) (Virtual Console)
- REL (extracted .tgc game from the Collector's Edition disc) (GameCube)
