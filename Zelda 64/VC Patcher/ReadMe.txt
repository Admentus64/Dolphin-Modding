Zelda 64 VC WAD Patcher

Patches the USA Virtual Console Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask with the Dawn & Dusk patch (LuigiBlood), Spanish Translation patch (eduardo_a2j) or Polish Translation patch (AndriejSiergiej / Berlov).


INSTRUCTIONS:

- To run this patcher, right click and select "Run with PowerShell".

- Drag and Drop your WAD file or select it with the [...] button.

- Press the "Dawn and Dusk", "Spanish Translation", "Polish Translation" or "Custom Injection" button. Wait for it to finish.

- A custom injection requires a .Z64 rom to be set

- The patched WAD file is created in the same path as the original and the original is preserved.


NOTES:

- The original GameID for OoT USA is NACE and the original GameID for MM is NARE, the patcher changes the GameID to a different value. This is so all versions of the game (patched and unpatched) can have their own settings and cheats.

- Patched games do not work with existing AR/Gecko codes, except for Dawn & Dusk.
