SM64 VC 60FPS WAD Patcher

Patches the USA Virtual Console Super Mario 64 WAD with Kaze Emanuar's 60 FPS patch v2.


INSTRUCTIONS:

- To run this patcher, right click and select "Run with PowerShell".

- Drag and Drop your WAD file or select it with the [...] button.

- Press the "Patch" button. Wait for it to finish.

- The patched WAD file is created in the same path as the original and the original is preserved.


NOTES:

- The original GameID for SM64 USA is NAAE, this patch changes it to NAXE. This is so both versions
  of the game (patched and unpatched) can have their own settings and cheats.

- Mario camera does not work. The game will not even allow you to switch to it.

- This version of the code does not have widescreen. Use AR/Gecko codes for widescreen.
