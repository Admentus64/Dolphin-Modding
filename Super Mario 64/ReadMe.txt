Patches the USA Virtual Console Super Mario 64 WAD with the 60 FPS patch v2 (Kaze Emanuar), Analog Camera patch (Kaze Emanuar) or Multiplayer v1.4.2 patch (Skelux).


INSTRUCTIONS:

- To run this patcher, right click and select "Run with PowerShell".

- Drag and Drop your WAD file or select it with the [...] button.

- Press the "60 FPS", "Analog Camera" or "Multiplayer" button. Wait for it to finish.

- The patched WAD file is created in the same path as the original and the original is preserved.


NOTES:

- The original GameID for SM64 USA is NAAE, this patch changes it to NAAX, NAAY or NAAM. This is so all versions of the game (patched and unpatched) can have their own settings and cheats.

- Mario camera does not work in 60 FPS. The game will not even allow you to switch to it.

- The demo intro is broke in in 60 FPS. Just skip it.

- Enabled the second emulated controller for the Analog Camera and Multiplayer patches.

- Bind the Control Stick of the second emulator controller to the secondary analog stick on your primary physical controller for the Analog Camera patch.

- Patched games can work with existing AR/Gecko codes. The Multiplayer v1.4.2 patch requires different AR/Gecko codes.

- To fix flickering textures:
	* Enable the CPU Clock Override and set it to 150% or higher.
	* Prefetch the texture pack.
	* Set Texture Cache to Safe
